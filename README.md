This project was my recreation of the Linked List data structure in the language of Ruby. The reason for having completed this project was to have gained an understanding of dynamic data structures, to give myself a foundation of more complex data structures such as graphs and binary trees.

The creation of this project was a struggle in the beginning, as I had a hard time wrapping my head around how the traversal of my LinkedList instance would work.

Once I was able to figure out the code behind traversing the list to perform the first method, #append, the rest of the project came together with ease.
